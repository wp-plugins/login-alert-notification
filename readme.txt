Notify alerts with Email and Push Notifiaction Services if detected someone accessing login form.

== Description ==

Notify alerts of login success/failure to your Windows, Mac, Tablet PC and Smartphones via Email and push notification services such as Prowl, Notify My Android, im.kayac.com and Pushover if detected someone trying to your WordPress login form.

You can also exclude annoying notification like admin user's access if you've already removed it from user list. And if someone fails to login then redirected to blog top page URL.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. 'Login Alert Notification' menu in Settings
1. Enable/Disable notification method(s) and input username and/or key etc.
1. Save Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't receive the notification via email. =

Please check whether or not you fill in the email address of General &gt; Settings. I strongly recommend you put another email address to 'From' box of plugin settings.
